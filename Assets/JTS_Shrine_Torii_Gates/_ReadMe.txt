I. IMPORT FILES INTO YOUR PROJCT
Go to: “Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package...” in the Unity Menu and select the "Shrine_Torii_Gates_ver1.x.unitypackage” file. This will open an import dialog box. Click the import button and all files will be imported into your project list under a folder called JTS_Shrine_Torii_Gates.

II. ADD ART PREFABS TO YOUR SCENE
In the /PREFABS folder you will find all StoneLanterns as individual game prefabs which you can use in your scene.  Simply select the prefab you wish to use and drag it into your scene.

A NOTE ABOUT UNITY HDRP / LWRP PIPELINES
----------------------------------------
Currently Unity Scriptable Render Pipelines are still under heavy development and are not well supported by Unity.  As they become more popular by Unity customers, and are better supported by Unity I will consider releaseing a version of this asset pack specific for those pipelines.  The art in this pack uses the Standard Unity shader on all materials, and there are some automatic converters available from Unity that will convert Standard materials into LWRP materials.  I'm not currently aware of converters for HDRP.
